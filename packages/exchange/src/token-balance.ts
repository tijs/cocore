// Token-balance ledger.
//
// Sqlite-backed runtime over four tables:
//
//   token_balance         did -> current balance + last-touch timestamps
//   token_event           audit log; one row per balance change
//   processed_receipt     idempotency: receipt URI -> processed_at
//   processed_period      idempotency: patronage period -> processed_at
//
// ## Mechanics
//
//   * Conservation 95/5. `applyReceipt` is a three-way transfer:
//     requester `-tokens`; provider `+tokens * (1 - feeBps/10000)`;
//     treasury `+remainder`. No tokens are minted or burned; the
//     event log sums to zero per receipt.
//   * Lazy grant. `getOrInitBalance` mints `tokenGrant` the first
//     time a DID is touched, writes a `grant` event.
//   * Lazy weekly refresh. `applyRefreshIfDue` mints
//     `weeklyRefresh.amountPerDid` once per `cadenceMinutes` window
//     when the DID's balance is touched. Dormant DIDs accrue
//     nothing — the "use-it-to-keep-it" semantic.
//   * Monthly patronage. `distributePatronage` takes a half-open
//     `[start, end)` window, sums every DID's |delta| over `kind
//     IN ('receipt-in','receipt-out')` events in the window, and
//     debits the treasury by `fractionBps / 10000` of its balance
//     pro-rata across active DIDs. Idempotent on `(start, end)`.
//
// All balance-changing operations are single sqlite transactions
// that update `token_balance` and append `token_event` rows. The
// audit log is the canonical history; the balance column is a cache
// of `sum(token_event.tokens_delta) per did`.

  /** End-to-end audit of the ledger's state. Verifies the
   *  invariants that any honest closed-loop ledger MUST hold:
   *
   *  1. **Conservation.** Sum of every `tokens_delta` in
   *     `token_event` equals the sum of mints (grant + refresh)
   *     minus burns (currently none — soft decay was removed). Any
   *     non-mint event must net to zero across its participants
   *     (receipts split 3 ways but sum to zero; patronage debits
   *     treasury and credits recipients in equal measure).
   *  2. **Cache integrity.** Each row in `token_balance.tokens` is
   *     a denormalized cache of `SUM(token_event.tokens_delta)`
   *     for that DID. If the cache drifts from the audit log,
   *     the cache is wrong (the audit log is canonical).
   *  3. **Non-negative balances.** The CHECK constraint on
   *     `token_balance.tokens >= 0` should never let us see a
   *     negative balance — surface anyway as a belt-and-suspenders
   *     check.
   *  4. **Idempotency tables.** Every receipt URI appears at most
   *     once in `processed_receipt`; every (period_start, period_end)
   *     appears at most once in `processed_period`. The PRIMARY
   *     KEYs enforce this; we surface the row count + uniqueness
   *     as a sanity number.
   *  5. **System total.** Sum of every balance equals the sum of
   *     every mint event. A drift here means either a balance was
   *     credited without an event row, or vice versa.
   *
   *  Returns a structured report a caller can stuff into JSON or
   *  feed to a dashboard. `ok: true` means every invariant held.
   *
   *  Cheap to run — every check is one indexed SQL aggregation.
   *  Designed to be hit on demand by an operator (or a 5-min cron)
   *  for launch-day reconciliation. */
