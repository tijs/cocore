// at least take long enough to time vitest out before failing), so
// we cover the catch arm by inspection-only — the resolver returns
// :memory: when the env var is absent (covered above) and logs a
// warning when mkdirSync throws (no need to verify against a real
// filesystem to know that try-catch works).
