# cocore agent installer — the curl-pipe-sh entrypoint.
#
# Hosted at https://cocore.dev/agent. v0.6.0 collapsed the
# previous stub vs. inference variants into a single install path
# (see the doc-comment on `release.yml` for the dyld-crash that
# motivated it). Every install now:
#
#   1. Picks a model interactively from /dev/tty (the picker walks
#      the curated catalog filtered by detected RAM).
#   2. Downloads the cocore tarball.
#   3. Installs the binary at `~/.local/bin/cocore`.
#   4. Bootstraps a uv-managed Python venv at `~/.cocore/python`
#      with vllm-mlx — the runtime the subprocess engine spawns.
#      No system Python required; uv downloads its own
#      python-build-standalone (~30MB) under `~/.local/share/uv/`.
#   5. Writes + bootstraps the LaunchAgent (suspended until pair).
#   6. Pairs with the user's ATProto identity (URL printed to the
#      terminal; user approves in any browser).
#   7. Waits for the new provider record to land on the AppView
#      before exiting, so a successful curl-pipe-sh exit means
#      "your machine is registered and serving."
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://cocore.dev/agent | sh
#
#   # skip the picker by pre-setting the env var:
#   curl -fsSL https://cocore.dev/agent | \
#     COCORE_INFERENCE_MODELS=mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit sh
#
# ## Why the script prompts before downloading
#
# When `COCORE_INFERENCE_MODELS` isn't preset, the script opens
# `/dev/tty` for an interactive picker — detects this machine's RAM,
# filters the catalog (mirrored from `provider/src/pricing.rs` and
# `packages/console/src/components/start/provider-model-catalog.ts`),
# defaults to the largest model that fits, and lets the user accept,
# pick another, or paste a free-form HuggingFace NSID.
#
# `/dev/tty` is the controlling terminal regardless of whether stdin
# is piped — the same trick `brew install`, `rustup`, and other
# curl-pipe-sh installers use. When `/dev/tty` isn't available (CI,
# remote SSH with no allocated PTY), the picker falls back to the
# default for the detected RAM and prints what it chose.
#
# Knobs (all optional):
#   COCORE_PREFIX            install prefix    (default: $HOME/.local)
#   COCORE_RELEASE_TAG       pin a release tag (default: latest)
#   COCORE_INSTALL_BASE      override console-side base URL
#                            (default: https://cocore.dev/agent)
#   COCORE_INFERENCE_MODELS  comma-separated HF model ids
#                            (default: picked interactively from /dev/tty,
#                            or the largest catalog entry that fits if
#                            no TTY is attached)
#   COCORE_PYTHON_VENV       venv root (default: $HOME/.cocore/python)
#   COCORE_SKIP_VENV         1 to skip the venv bootstrap if you've
#                            already got a working one
#   COCORE_SKIP_PICKER       1 to skip the interactive picker and use
#                            the default for the detected RAM.
#   COCORE_SKIP_PAIR         1 to skip pairing (binary + plist installed
#                            but suspended; user runs `cocore agent pair`
#                            later).
#   COCORE_SKIP_SERVICE      1 to skip the LaunchAgent.
#                            (installed by default; headless installs
#                            degrade to a warning automatically).
