// CoCoreMLX: native in-process MLX inference engine the Rust agent links over a
// C ABI (mirrors provider/enclave). Uses the upstream, Apache-2.0 MLX-Swift
// stack (NOT darkbloom's proprietary code) — the same libraries darkbloom's
// provider-swift builds on. The prompt is decrypted + run entirely inside this
// statically-linked code, so the measured `cocore` binary covers it.
